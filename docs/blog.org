just my thoughts during the project.

** Nov. 17 2025
i have no idea how to start this, but lets have a try now shall we? i also don't
really know how to write CMakeList.txt or a Makefile...

** Nov. 19 2025
makefiles are... something. i can't even parse requests :sob:. It'll get better
soon, i hope..

IT FUCKING WORKS I KNOW I STOLE A LOT OF THIS FROM ANOTHER REPO BUT LIKE I DON"T
GIVE A SHIT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA (i did a HTTP/1.1 200 OK response..) NOW ALL
I NEED TO DO IS DISPLAY HTML, CSS AND JS FILES LMAOOO
